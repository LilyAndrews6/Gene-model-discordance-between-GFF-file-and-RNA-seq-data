# Gene-model-discordance-between-GFF-file-and-RNA-seq-data
This repository converts single stranded RNA-seq data into a BigWig file which can be opened in FungiDB when investigating fungi genomes (or the organism specific EuPathDB site) where coverage plots can be produced. These coverage plots can be downloaded and compared against a GFF file (new genomic data against a gene model) through the use of the python code. This will display the discordance between the datasets by outputting the identical coordinates between the two datasets for "mRNA" and "exon" which reach a coverage threshold of 15. This workflow and code can be edited by any individual to make it specific to their experiment and requirements.
